    <h2>What I am looking for</h2>
    <p>Working in a team of developers with strong colaboration (code review, collective ownership, pair programming, etc)</p>
    <p>Flexibility is key I prefer to work in the outcome rather than working hours</p>
    <p>It is important to know that you focus on grow and learning of your employees and make them better</p>
