    <h1>Recruiters FAQ</h1>
    <p>Thank you for taking interest in my profile as a developer.</p>
    <p>In regards to save both us some time I will give some information related to looking for a job.</p>
    <h2>Current situation</h2>
    <p>I'am currently unemployed.</p>
    <p>Actively looking for a new job, so contact me if I can fit the position you are looking for.</p>
    
    <h2>What I am looking for?</h2>
    <p>Working in a team of developers with strong colaboration (code review, collective ownership, pair programming, etc)</p>
    <p>A clear career path is a really nice thing to have so tell me about it if your company has one or is considering working on it</p>
    <p>Ideally your company is tech oriented so as a developer I can feel comfortable doing tests, refactor and improve the quality of the code.</p>
    <p>Flexibility is key I prefer to work in the outcome rather than working hours</p>
    <p>It is important to know that you focus on grow and learning of your employees and make them better</p>
    <p>Be assertive about what is the position for, I want to know what I will be doing</p>
    <p>Regarding the stack I dont actually prefer one above other I'm fine with any stack as long as is used (not cobol or old techs)</p>
